# **GSEA_Pathway_Analysis**  
**Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of Pathways in High vs. Low Prognosis Models**  

## **Methods**  

### **Parameters**  

- **Data File**: RNA-seq data for the three models of interest:  
  - `Res_allgenes_highvslow_model8_Deseq2_RSEM.csv`  

- **Gene Classification**: Genes are classified based on their **CFL** value. A list of genes is generated, each associated with a CFL score.  
- **Gene Sets**: The **Hallmark gene sets** for Homo sapiens (species 'hs', category 'H') consist of **50 pathways**.  
- **Fgsea**: A cluster is composed of a minimum of 15 genes and a maximum of 500 genes.

### **Methods Overview**  

- **Collapse List of Enriched Pathways**: This step reduces similar pathways, returning a list of independent enriched pathways.  
- **Clustering Similar Gene Sets**: To interpret a large number of biological pathways, we group similar gene sets based on gene overlap. This approach reveals if gene sets related to the same function are similarly affected, providing a clearer understanding of pathway deregulation.  
  - **Distance Measure**: Jaccard distance is used to measure overlap between gene sets (Set1 âˆª Set2).  
  - **Cluster 0**: Represents a "trash" cluster that is discarded.
